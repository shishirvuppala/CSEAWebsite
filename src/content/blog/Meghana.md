## Internship Experience - IBM

Hey there! I’m Meghana, a to-be third-year UG student in the CSE department. My co-interns called me a poindexter, though I’m quite sure my homies would disagree. I like travelling and hanging out as much as I like binging shows and movies tucked in my bed. I also like exploring and creating things which are of some real value which is why I’m satiated with my 70 days long internship with IBM.

It all started when amid an ocean of deadlines and assignments, companies started lining up to hire summer interns. The IBM Extreme Blue internship is a research intern and IBM is well known for its premier research in the software industry, so I applied for it through the placement cell. After a basic cognitive ability test, I received a mail stating that they’d like to interview me for the internship. The interview was purely technical with questions on Data Structures and basic Python. There were also some questions based on the projects in my resume and in the end they asked me what my preferred area of work would be. There I put out my interest stating that I would be very happy if I get to work on a project involving Machine Learning.
