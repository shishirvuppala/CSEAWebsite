## Internship Experience - Goldman Sachs

How would you describe the working environment?: 
My guides were actually working from London, so I used to start working quite late in the morning and end quite late at night. Work timings changed every day depending on how much work was left. Few days were extremely hectic and I had to do night outs to keep up to the expectations, whereas a few were comparatively very chill and I used to go to bed by 11pm itself. But overall, my guides were really helpful throughout and none of my ideas were discarded, instead, they always supported my approach and suggested a few modifications. Also, even though I did nothing but concentrate on the intern work for the last 3 weeks, it was worth the time and I really liked the project as a whole.

How was your experience otherwise?: 
The internship was work from home for us, so I canâ€™t comment on the work environment as such, but I have heard from the seniors who have worked at GS that they have one of the best offices in Bangalore in terms of infrastructure and desktop setups.
