## BITSTREAM EDITOR

# Bitstream newsletter 2024

Hello Everyone,
Greetings from the BitStream team.

We, the students at CSE, IITB put on our editor and designer hats to bring out a revamped edition of BitStream, the CSE newsletter after last year's hiatus. With this one, we've gone all in, covering insightful perspectives from alumni and professor interviews, personal pieces that hit close, and geeky analyses of the world around us. And of course, comic relief aplenty.

You can also read [here](https://issuu.com/bitstream-cse/docs/2024)

You can download the pdf version [here](/docs/bitstream-digital-24.pdf)

Let us know your feedback, appreciation, or criticism by emailing us at editor@cse.iitb.ac.in

Cheers
BitStream Team 2023-24
