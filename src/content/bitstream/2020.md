## BitStream newsletter

# BitStream Newsletter 2020-21

Hello Everyone,
Greetings from the BitStream team.

We, along with CSEA, bring you the newest edition of BitStream. For those who are new, BitStream is our department's newsletter and is solely run by CSE students. This year, with the newly constituted team's initiative, we revived the newsletter from two years into oblivion.
We hope you all will enjoy reading this edition of BitStream and appreciate the efforts put forward by the team.
Feel free to reach out to us for any queries, suggestions, or ideas.
Please, Download the newsletter [here](/docs/bitstream-digital-2020.pdf) .

Cheers
BitStream Team 2020-21
